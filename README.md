# NYCU AI Capstone Spring 2025 - Project #2: Reinforcement Learning

### Overview
This project explores reinforcement learning (RL) using environments from Gymnasium, a maintained fork of OpenAI Gym. The project implements and trains RL agents on two tasks:
1. Breakout (Atari environment)
   
2. MountainCar-v0 (Classic control environment)

The implementation includes Deep Q-Learning (DQN) for Breakout and Q-Learning/SARSA for MountainCar-v0. The goal is to experiment with different parameters and analyze their effects on agent performance.
